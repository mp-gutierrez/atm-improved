Title of the project
    ATM - deposits and withdrawals

Description
    ATM application with deposit and withdrawal features. 


Installation
    In order to run the program, all the files need to be downloaded into the same folder, keeping each file name and its extension intact. After running a local server, you can go to http://localhost:8080/ to load and interact with the program.

Usage
    With a starting Account Balance of 0, you can select between the 'deposit' and 'withdrawal' options from a dropdown menu. You can deposit money and, with the sufficient funds, withdraw it.
